Run yarn or npm install to get everything installed.

This is somewhat simplified workflow that i use.

Gulp is used as taskruner, webpack as module bundler. I use Pug former Jade for templating and since you wanted Bootstrap it makes it super hard to use so i opted for writting plain html directly into the dist folder.


P.S That modal and not including icons or any mesurments is cheap shoot. Modal that you have invisioned will never work,
it is bad UI/UX and would irittate living hell out of user. Using sweet-modal and 3 step tabbed approach is way better.

Pulling data from selection is bad idea and kinda arhaic and hardly done with jquery, use React instead.

P.S.S I do not know how anyone uses bootstrap it is simply impossible to keep track of everything, I did not even bother documenting anything i just wanted it to work.

I excluded node_modules for obvious reasons.
